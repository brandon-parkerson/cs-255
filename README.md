## Summary
The DriverPass project involved creating a software solution for a client who wanted to develop an application that helps users prepare for their driving tests. The client requested a system that offers online driving lessons, practice tests, and scheduling for both virtual and in-person driving lessons. The goal was to design an intuitive and user-friendly system that caters to both students and instructors.
## What I Did Well
I excelled at creating the UML use case diagram and defining clear system requirements. By focusing on the main features requested by the client, such as lesson scheduling and test simulations, I could present a cohesive and easy-to-understand model that represented the core functionalities of the system. Additionally, my attention to user experience and accessibility aspects ensured that the design was inclusive and effective.
## What Would I Revise
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the system architecture document. While the initial document covered the basic components and their relationships, I would like to improve it by adding more detailed flow diagrams that better illustrate data exchanges between components. This would give stakeholders a clearer understanding of the overall system and its interdependencies.
## How Did I Interpret User's Needs
To interpret the user’s needs, I focused on the core goals they expressed, such as simplifying the scheduling process and enhancing the effectiveness of test preparation. I utilized user stories and gathered requirements based on their desired outcomes, which I translated into actionable design elements. I ensured that the application offered a straightforward booking interface, a user-friendly lesson system, and comprehensive test simulations.
## How I Approach Designing Software
My approach to software design begins with gathering and analyzing requirements through user interviews, research, and creating user stories. I then move on to creating visual models, such as use case diagrams and wireframes, to map out functionalities. This helps me identify potential issues early in the process and ensures alignment with the client’s goals.
